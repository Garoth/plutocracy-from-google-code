= List of Ground Buildings =
These buildings must be constructed on a rented ground tile. The owner of the tile may demolish the building and partially recoup construction materials.

  * If built on a hot tile, generates small amount of sugar and cotton
  * Generic structure that boosts the efficiency of all Fields

=== Sugarcane ===

== Mills ==

=== Mill ===
  * Generates a small amount of lumber and fruit
  * Generic structure that boosts the efficiency of all Mills

=== Sawmill ===
  * Generates Lumber

  * Generates Furniture

== Mines ==

=== Mine ===
  * Generates a small amount of ore, sulfur, and/or gemstone depending on availability
  * Generic structure that boosts the efficiency of all Mines

  * Depletes Iron reserves of Mountain tiles on owner's land

=== Sulfur Mine ===
  * Generates Sulfur
  * Depletes Sulfur reserves of Mountain tiles on owner's land

=== Gem Mine ===
  * Generates Gemstone
  * Depletes Gemstone reserves of Mountain tiles on owner's land

== Guildhalls ==

=== Guildhall ===
  * Generates a small amount of bread, rum, textiles, and rope

= List of Shallow Water Buildings ==
These buildings may be constructed on a rented shallow water tile up to 3 tiles away from shore. The owner of the tile may demolish the building and partially recoup construction materials.

== Dock ==
  * Allows ships to trade with and transfer goods to land tiles
  * Provides a small amount of storage capacity for goods
  * Can be raided by hostile ships for a portion of goods on the island
  * Can be upgraded to a Shipyard

== Shipyard ==
  * Can be used to construct and repair ships
  * Provides a small amount of storage capacity for goods

== Tower ==
  * Stores Roundshot
  * Attacks hostile ships up to 2 tiles away
  * Uses one Roundshot for every shot

== Barricade ==
  * Blocks ships
  * Connects to another raft to extend
  * If a section of raft is "cut" and has no connection to shore, it sinks
