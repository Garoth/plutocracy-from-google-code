# An explanation of how expansion works

1) After you have a dock and town centre established, you can start expanding to adjacent spaces. (See [Tut-Settling].) You will be given a selection of nearby tiles to spread to. Note: shoreline tiles are special.

2) Select one of the spaces to start renting it. Note: you never "own" a space, you rent it from the Island's government and repeatedly pay a fee.

3) After you own a space, you can build a structure there.
