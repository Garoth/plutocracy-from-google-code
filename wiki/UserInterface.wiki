#summary Detailing of the User Interface and User Interaction

= Philosophy =
A user interface for a real time strategy game should, in the philosophy of
David Sev, be broken up into parts:
  * Always-visible information that you refer to very frequently.
  * Tools that you use relatively frequently.
  * Configuration options that you want to see once in a while.

Also, a well-known rule of user-interface design is, "The bigger and closer
an object is to the mouse, the easier it is to use."

Finally, I believe that a user interface is not something that you should have
to spend a tremendously long time learning for a game. It should be relatively
intuitive and easy. There should certainly not be a 200 page book to explain
how easy it really is.

As such, the Plutocracy UI tries to make use of some of the more modern
UI ideas such as circular menus. The UI tries to separate things that you
want to see often from stuff you only occasionally want to see. (It however
tries to keep those things you want to occasionally see within easy reach.)
And it tries to keep things as contextual as possible, rather than forcing
the user to dig around to find the controls that they want.

Following this style of interface design, a new player would only have to
learn a couple simple rules for how to use it, and then be able to use it
quickly and efficiently, learning new parts of it as they pop up onto the
screen.

== Ring Menus == 

So the first thing I want to define are the different kinds of UI elements
that are used in Plutocracy.

First and probably most important is what we define as the *ring menu*.
A ring menu is commonly referred to as a circular menu. Basically, it is
a menu that pops up when you click on something, but it has icons arranged
in a ring rather than a drop down.

In Plutocracy, ring menus are used extremely frequently as object-to-object
or objects-to-object interaction tools. Most *control windows* are opened
as a result of a ring menu operation. For example, if you want to have one
ship trade with another ship, you select your ship by left-clicking on it,
and then select the target by right-clicking on it. After you right-click
on the target ship, it opens a ring menu around that ship, offering some
options such as "attack", "follow", and "trade". Clicking trade then has
your ship sail over to the other ship and opens up the trade controls.
