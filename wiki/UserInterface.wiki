#summary Detailing of the User Interface and User Interaction

= Philosophy =
A user interface for a real time strategy game should, in the philosophy of
David Sev, be broken up into parts:

  * Level 1: Always-visible information that you refer to very frequently.
  * Level 2: Tools that you use relatively frequently.
  * Level 3: Configuration options that you want to see once in a while.

Secondly, a well-known rule of user-interface design is, "The bigger and closer
an object is to the mouse, the easier it is to use."

Thirdly, the interface for a game like Plutocracy needs to be customizable
for two reasons:

  # A user's preferences
  # Plutocracy is meant to be able to support multiple game modes, as well as plug-in game modes. The UI needs to flexibly bend to show different information for different game styles.

Fourthly, as a user of a tiling window manager, I subscribe to the
philosophy that no one really wants overlapping windows. If you watch the
behaviour of a lot of Windows users, they either take a lot of time carefully
arranging their windows to be side-by-side, or maximize a lot and use the
window list (or alt-tab) to pick which windows they want to be using.

Finally, I believe that a user interface is not something that you should have
to spend a tremendously long time learning for a game. It should be relatively
intuitive and easy. There should certainly not be a 200 page book to explain
how easy it really is.

As such, the Plutocracy UI tries to make use of some of the more modern
UI ideas such as circular menus. The UI tries to separate things that you
want to see often from stuff you only occasionally want to see. (It however
tries to keep those things you want to occasionally see within easy reach.)
It tries to keep things as contextual as possible, rather than forcing
the user to dig around to find the controls that they want. And finally,
it tries to have floating windows that don't overlap wherever possible.

Following this style of interface design, a new player would only have to
learn a couple simple rules for how to use it, and then be able to use it
quickly and efficiently, learning new parts of it as they pop up onto the
screen.

== General Information About Windows ==

Before I explain the different types of UI that exist in Plutocracy, 
I will set down some ground rules for most windows. It should be obvious
when these apply.

== Ring Menus == 

*IMAGE OF RING MENU HERE*

So the first thing I want to define are the different kinds of UI elements
that are used in Plutocracy.

First and probably most important is what we define as the *ring menu*.
A ring menu is commonly referred to as a circular menu. Basically, it is
a menu that pops up when you click on something, but it has icons arranged
in a ring rather than a drop down.

In Plutocracy, ring menus are used extremely frequently as object-to-object,
objects-to-object, or object-to-self interaction tools.
Most *control windows* are opened as a result of a ring menu
operation. For example, if you want to have one
ship trade with another ship, you select your ship by left-clicking on it,
and then select the target by right-clicking on it. After you right-click
on the target ship, it opens a ring menu around that ship, offering some
options such as "attack", "follow", and "trade". Clicking trade then has
your ship sail over to the other ship and opens up the trade controls.

Some rules about ring menus -- right clicking an object will:

  * If a different object is selected than the one you're right-clicking, the game will try to open a contextual ring menu between the two of them.
  * If no context exists, the game will select the right-clicked object and open its "self" ring menu.
  * If the object is selected and it is right clicked, the *self ring menu* will open up for sure.
  * If no self menu exists, nothing happens.
  * The *self ring menu* has an extra decorative ring around it to separate it visually from the *context ring menu*.
  * Ring menus are always the same size, and always have the icons in the same order and locations. This is done so that once you get comfortable with the locations, you can blaze through ring menus kind of like doing mouse gestures.
    
== Control Windows == 

*IMAGE OF WHERE THE CONTROL WINDOWS GO IN THE UI, WITH EXAMPLE WINDOW*

I had briefly mentioned *control windows* above. Control windows are what
I classify as the Level 2 type windows in the Philosophy section. They have
very useful information and tools, but you only want to see them once in
a while.

These windows could also be called contextual windows, as they are used
contextually. When you need to trade, you get the *manual trade control
window* (described below). When you're done trading, it goes away. To relate
to the regular desktop, this could be similar to a program that decompresses
zipped files. Something that you want to see very frequently should be a
*widget window* (see *Widget Windows* section). An example of one of those might
be the *game scoreboard widget*.

*Control windows* spawn in the central area of the screen, right on top of the
globe. That kind of puts them in the way, but you should only need to interact
with one for a little while, and have the option of filing it away in the
*minimized windows widget*. However, whenever possible, the control windows
should not overlap the widgets, which have space reserved for them.

Now I will describe the *control windows* that exist in Plutocracy.

=== Manual Trade Control Window ===

*IMAGE OF MANUAL TRADE CONTROL WINDOW*

*Opens:* through ring menu, as a result of one object being selected and
another right-clicked, followed by a click on the trade icon.

*Points About This Window:*

  * There is an icon for each resource type the object has. Hovering over one such icon _instantly_ opens a *tooltip pop-up control*, which simply says what the resource is.
  * Trade is done by dragging one of your resources onto your offering area. When you drag a resource in that area, an *amount selector pop-up control* spawns, to make it possible to select the amount.  The default is 1.
  * Once you're content with what the other person is offering, press the "Accept" button. After the person you're trading with has pressed Accept, you may no longer remove anything offered from your offering area. Of course, you may still add things, but chances are that this is not what you want to do (ie. they've already accepted less).
  * If you want to remove something before the other person has pressed accept, you just drag it from the offering area back onto your inventory area. Another *amount selector pop-up control* will spawn asking you how much to remove. The default is all.
  * Cancel button cancels the trade altogether.
