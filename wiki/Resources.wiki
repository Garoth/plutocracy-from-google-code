#summary A list of producible resources and commodities

= Trees =
  * The map is largely covered in trees at the start of the game
  * Will regrow and can be replanted but take a long time to do so
  * Different types grow in different climates (with some randomness):
    * Cold tiles produce Pine Trees
    * Moderate tiles produce Apple Trees
    * Hot tiles produce Banana Trees

= First Tier (Harvested Resources) =

== Lumber ==
  * Harvested by building Sawmills by trees
  * Efficiency depends on tree type:
    * Pine trees: 100%
    * Apple trees: 50%
    * Banana trees: 25%
  * Used in building and ship construction

== Fruit ==
  * Harvested by building Orchards by trees
  * Efficiency depends on tree type:
    * Pine trees: 25%
    * Apple trees: 50%
    * Banana trees: 100%
  * Consumed by ship crew and islands for sustenance

== Grain ==
  * Harvested by building Wheat Fields on Hot tiles
  * Not used directly

== Cotton ==
  * Harvested by building Cotton Fields on Moderate tiles
  * Not used directly

== Iron Ore ==
  * Harvested by building Ore Mines next to Mountain tiles
  * Not used directly

== Sulfur ==
  * Harvested by building Sulfur Mines next to Mountain tiles
  * Not used directly

= Second Tier (Intermediate Products) =

== Cloth ==
  * Refined from Cotton
  * Consumed by towns for growth

== Steel ==
  * Refined from Iron Ore
  * Used in ship and building construction

= Third Tier (Refined Commodities) =

== Fertilizer ==
  * Refined from Sulfur
  * Consumed by Fields to boost production

== Shirts ==
  * Refined from Cloth
  * Consumed by towns for growth

== Furniture ==
  * Refined from Lumber
  * Consumed by towns for growth

== Sails ==
  * Refined from Cloth and Lumber
  * Equipped by ships

== Cannon ==
  * Refined from Steel at Armory
  * Equipped by ships

== Armor Plate ==
  * Refined from Steel at Armory
  * Equipped by ships

== Solid, Grapeshot, Chainshot Cannonballs ==
  * Refined from Iron Ore and Sulfur at Armory
  * Equipped by ships

= Missing Resources =
This is stuff that thematically or traditionally it makes sense to have but we haven't placed yet:
  * Rum
  * Bricks
  * Tools
