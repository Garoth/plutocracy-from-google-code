#summary A list of producible resources and commodities

= Resource Value =
Ship crews and towns both consume food regularly and towns consume luxury items
to grow. The amount their need is satiated (and thus the amount they pay)
depends on the food or luxury value of the good. Additionally, towns value
luxury variety and will pay more for luxury items they rarely receive.

= Trees =
  * The map is largely covered in trees at the start of the game
  * Will regrow and forests can spread to adjacent tiles
  * Different types grow in different climates (with some randomness):
    * Cold tiles produce Conifer Trees
    * Moderate tiles produce Deciduous Trees
    * Hot tiles produce Palm Trees

= Harvested Resources =

== Lumber ==
  * Harvested from land you own by building Sawmills
  * Efficiency depends on tree type:
    * Conifer trees: 100%
    * Deciduous trees: 50%
    * Palm trees: 25%
  * Used in building and ship construction

== Fruit ==
  * Harvested by building Orchards by trees
  * Efficiency depends on tree type:
    * Conifer trees: 25%
    * Deciduous trees: 50%
    * Palm trees: 100%
  * Consumed by ship crew and towns for sustenance
  * Low food value

== Fish ==
  * Harvested by ships equipped with fish nets that pass fish tiles
  * Consumed by crew and towns for sustenance
  * Medium food value

== Sugar ==
  * Harvested by building Sugarcane Fields on Hot tiles
  * Luxury consumed by towns for growth
  * Low luxury value

== Cotton ==
  * Harvested by building Cotton Fields on Hot tiles
  * Not used directly

== Grain ==
  * Harvested by building Wheat Fields on Moderate tiles
  * Not used directly

== Iron Ore ==
  * Harvested by building Ore Mines next to Mountain tiles
  * Mountain tile must have iron ore
  * Not used directly

== Sulfur ==
  * Harvested by building Sulfur Mines next to Mountain tiles
  * Mountain tile must have sulfur
  * Not used directly

== Gemstone ==
  * Harvested by building Gem Mines next to Mountain tiles
  * Mountain tile must have gemstones
  * Luxury consumed by towns for growth
  * High luxury value

= Intermediate Products =

== Bread ==
  * Refined from Grain
  * Consumed by crews and towns for sustenance
  * Medium food value

== Textiles ==
  * Refined from Cotton
  * Luxury consumed by towns for growth
  * Medium luxury value

== Steel ==
  * Refined from Iron Ore and Lumber
  * Used in ship and building construction

== Fertilizer ==
  * Refined from Sulfur
  * Consumed by Fields to boost efficiency

== Rope ==
  * Refined from Cotton
  * Not used directly

= Refined Commodities =

== Rations ==
  * Refined from Bread, Sugar, Fruit, and Fish
  * Compressed form of sustenance for crew and towns
  * High food value

== Rum ==
  * Refined from Grain and Sugar
  * Consumed by ships to boost efficiency
  * Luxury consumed by towns for growth
  * Medium luxury value

== Fish Nets ==
  * Refined from Rope
  * Equipped by ships

== Sails ==
  * Refined from Textiles, Rope, and Lumber
  * Equipped by ships

== Cannon ==
  * Refined from Steel at Armory
  * Equipped by ships

== Armor Plate ==
  * Refined from Steel at Armory
  * Equipped by ships

== Solid, Grapeshot, Chainshot Cannonballs ==
  * Refined from Iron Ore and Sulfur at Armory
  * Equipped by ships
