#summary A list of producible resources and commodities

= Trees =
  * The map is largely covered in trees at the start of the game
  * Will regrow and forests can spread to adjacent tiles
  * Different types grow in different climates (with some randomness):
    * Cold tiles produce Conifer Trees
    * Moderate tiles produce Deciduous Trees
    * Hot tiles produce Palm Trees

= Harvested Resources =

== Lumber ==
  * Harvested from land you own by building Sawmills
  * Efficiency depends on tree type:
    * Conifer trees: 100%
    * Deciduous trees: 50%
    * Palm trees: 25%
  * Used in building and ship construction

== Fruit ==
  * Harvested by building Orchards by trees
  * Efficiency depends on tree type:
    * Conifer trees: 25%
    * Deciduous trees: 50%
    * Palm trees: 100%
  * Consumed by ship crew and towns for sustenance

== Fish ==
  * Harvested by ships equipped with fish nets that pass fish tiles
  * Consumed by crew and towns for sustenance

== Sugar ==
  * Harvested by building Sugarcane Fields on Hot tiles
  * Luxury consumed by towns for growth

== Cotton ==
  * Harvested by building Cotton Fields on Hot tiles
  * Not used directly

== Grain ==
  * Harvested by building Wheat Fields on Moderate tiles
  * Not used directly

== Iron Ore ==
  * Harvested by building Ore Mines next to Mountain tiles
  * Not used directly

== Sulfur ==
  * Harvested by building Sulfur Mines next to Mountain tiles
  * Not used directly

= Intermediate Products =

== Textiles ==
  * Refined from Cotton
  * Luxury consumed by towns for growth

== Steel ==
  * Refined from Iron Ore and Lumber
  * Used in ship and building construction

== Fertilizer ==
  * Refined from Sulfur
  * Consumed by Fields to boost efficiency

== Rope ==
  * Refined from Cotton
  * Not used directly

= Refined Commodities =

== Rations ==
  * Refined from Grain, Sugar, Fruit, and Fish
  * Compressed form of sustenance for crew and towns

== Rum ==
  * Refined from Grain and Sugar
  * Consumed by ships to boost efficiency
  * Luxury consumed by towns for growth

== Garments ==
  * Refined from Textiles
